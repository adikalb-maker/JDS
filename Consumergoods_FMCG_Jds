JD 11:

Identify Opportunities:



- We appreciate problem solvers, we like problem finders better. You would find yourself staring at the market segments you are after, looking for gaps that exist and find ways to capitalize on those opportunities.



- That of course would require knowledge of technological landscape, understanding the business impact of the challenges that exist and building a rationale to chase prospects in those areas.

Craft value propositions:



- The conviction for an objective, if not complemented by a sound plan of action is disillusionment in the making. We would very much like to skirt that situation. For that, you would need to create value proposition that establishes the reasoning behind why the prospects you chase should find us relevant.



- This makes understanding buyer personas, their context, journey, motivations, challenges, limitations and timing among other things. Yes, we do try to be scientific in our ways, while avoiding becoming Sheldon Cooper.

Design Campaigns:



- For the identified opportunities design and run campaigns 'selling' the value proposition. A 2-punch combo of inbound and outbound is what we practice today but your creativity would be welcome.



- The idea is to invite curiosity from prospects, turn that into attention through delightful packaging of an irresistible value proposition for the sweet moment we call WIN.

Drive Successful Closures:



- Chase, hunt and revive prospects creating and leveraging numerous channels and forums of communication with them.



- While the inbound and outbound teams create a lot of these forums for you to work your magic, you would need to inspire them through your ways of achieving those too. While their KPIs align with 'getting' those meetings, yours align with 'wins'.

Mentoring teams:



- The inside sales and marketing teams that work with you would often need your insights gained by virtue of having been close to the market and your understanding of the context, proposition, prospects and everything else that turns an 'attempt' into a 'win'.



- The intent would be to get them to get better qualified leads that you can close. Needless to say, this happens through your insights on their output and your solutions for improvement.
